Dr. Alessandro Leite is a researcher at INRIA, Paris-Saclay University, France. His research interests and expertise include machine learning, explainable AI methods, and neural networks applied to different domain problems.

**2. Keynote speaker – Dr. Peng Wei, George Washington University, USA

Topic: AI Safety and Certification in Learning-based Aviation Systems
Time: 16:20-16:40, 29/07/2022

Learning-based or data-driven aviation system functions such as machine perception, prediction, and planning/control are showing powerful capabilities to handle uncertainty, improve computational efficiency, and enhance scalability. But many aviation systems are safety-critical and need proper certification. In this talk, the speaker will briefly introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning based aircraft separation assurance function, and some potential approaches to verify or certify such a function.

Bio: Dr. Peng Wei is an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the George Washington University, with courtesy appointments at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and Computer Science Department. By contributing to the intersection of control, optimization, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, he and his team develop autonomy and certification tools for aviation, aeronautics and aerial robotics. His current focus is on safety, efficiency, and scalability of decision making systems in complex, uncertain and dynamic environments. He is leading the Intelligent Aerospace Systems Lab (IASL). Prof. Wei is an associate editor for AIAA Journal of Aerospace Information Systems. He serves as the chairman of the AIAA Air Transportation Systems Technical Committee. He received his Ph.D. degree in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University in 2013 and bachelor degree in Control Theory from Tsinghua University in 2007. 

**3. Keynote speaker – Prof. Paulo C. G. Costa, George Mason University - GMU, USA

Topic: Making Sense of AI and Its Applications in Different Domains of Discourse
Time: 16:40-17:00, 29/07/2022

The growing prominence of AI methods as a core aspect in the development of decision support systems might suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach for developing AI-based systems exist. Yet, problems such as the identification of which aspects are amenable to automation, the integration of the system interface with human operators, the ability to justify the outcomes to decision-makers, and the definition of domain semantics to support automation are all open research issues. We argue that a great deal of progress has been made in the last decades in terms of AI algorithms, but the same does not seem to be true when it comes to advanced representation techniques. In this conversation, we will explore the dangers of applying AI algorithms indiscriminately without careful consideration on its suitability to the problem at hand, while visiting potential solutions for developing better, more secure and reliable 
automated systems.

**4. Keynote speaker – Dr. Antonio Marcio Ferreira Crespo, McGill University, Canada 

Topic:  Artificial Intelligence and the shaping of new realities: what to expect from the Metaverse.
Time: 17:00-17:20, 29/07/2022
Our conventional reality shall properly acknowledge the existence of social networks comprising from millions to billions of active members. And even before fully understanding the sociological and psychological impacts of such massive remote social medias hosted interactions, we now face the potential migration of these individuals towards a new (virtual?) reality named Metaverse. Within such scenario, the talk addresses some insights on how the existing AI algorithms featured in the social medias platforms (facial recognition, textual analysis, targeted advertising, language translation, news feed, etc.), and their biases might impact the construction and the existence of the upcoming Metaverse.
